I am a 4th year Computer Games Application Development student at Abertay University.

## Excana

Excana was a game made for my third year. Eight of us (2 Programmers, 3 designers & 3 artists), worked together to create this game using unreal engine in around 3 months.
Perforce was used to allow the team to work simultaneously.

## DirectX 11 Scene

This scene was also made as a third year project.
